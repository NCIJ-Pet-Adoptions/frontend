# Getting Started
Created an organization with two repositories (Backend & Fronten). Forked and cloned these repositories: Frontend for React Code (user input) and Backend for Sqlite3, Sequelize, Express Code (database) then run <code class="w3-codespan">npm create-react-app </code> to add the relevant dependencies. Run <code class="w3-codespan">node seed.js</code> to seed the database and confirm tests pass.
Finally, run <code class="w3-codespan">npm run app.js</code> to run the express server and interact with the Routes using <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>.


# Planning Process
The planning process for NJIC-Pet-Adoptions consisted of:
- Daily Agile Standup meetings lead by the Scrum Master/Product Owner who reviewed our progress and offered suggestions on staying on track movings forward with this project as well as helping to resolve any blockers and completing our Daily Exit Ticket. 
- As a team we were able to identify the task(s) needed to completed the MVP:
- We assigned task according to a persons strength for individual task and pared them with another person for strenthening of skill sets.
- We studied together learning React coding by watching our class Introduction to React video and discussing our misunderstanding with each other. We also continued studying on our own to learn React coding.
